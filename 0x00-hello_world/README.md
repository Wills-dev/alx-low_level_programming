# Introduction to C
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX school. The aim of this is to learn about how to include header files and macros in C language.

## Technologies
* Cfiles are complied using gcc 4.8.4
* Cfiles are written according to C90 standard
* tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description|

| 0-preprocessor |  A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.|
| 1-compiler |  A script that compiles a C file but does not link. |
| 2-assembler | A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.|
| 3-name | A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. |
| 4-puts.c | A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.|
| 5-printf.c |  A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.|
| 6-size.c | A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.|
| 100-intel |  A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.|
